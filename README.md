# LondonBikeSharing

In this project I use the London Bike Sharing Dataset available on Kaggle (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset)

Using the downloaded csv file I inspect and modify its contents using *Python* (**Pandas**, **zipfile**). Some of the data in the original file was not formatted properly, 
but with Python I was able to manipulate the file and map some of the data with usuable values. After exporting the updated data, I used data visualization software **Tableau**
to create interactive graphics to help better understand the data.

With the visualization I created, viewers can easily visualize **Moving Averages**, and a **Heat Map of Weather Conditions** over a selected period of time.
